## Unicorns Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Unicorns Data Analysis Project! In this project, we will perform various data structuring, cleaning, and analysis tasks to provide insights into unicorn companies – those valued at over one billion dollars.

### Activity 1: Structure Your Data

#### Introduction
In this activity, we will focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and datetime transformations to better understand the data. You will learn how to structure data effectively, uncover characteristics of the dataset, and use visualizations to draw meaningful insights.

#### Key Steps
1. Analyze and explore the unicorn companies’ dataset.
2. Perform datetime transformations and data structuring.
3. Utilize visualizations to analyze trends and patterns in the data.
4. Draw conclusions and insights from the dataset.

### Activity 2: Addressing Missing Data

#### Introduction
Addressing missing data is a crucial step in data analysis. In this activity, we will learn how to handle missing values and prepare data for analysis.

#### Key Steps
1. Identify missing values in the unicorn companies’ dataset.
2. Address missing data using appropriate techniques.
3. Provide required data subsets and visualizations for the investor's inquiries.

### Activity 3: Validate and Clean Your Data

#### Introduction
In this activity, we will use input validation and label encoding techniques to prepare a dataset for analysis. These fundamental techniques are essential for data analysis across various domains.

#### Key Steps
1. Validate input data and ensure data consistency.
2. Perform label encoding to transform categorical data.
3. Prepare the dataset for analysis, focusing on the top unicorn investors.

### Project Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and datetime transformations to understand unicorn company data.
- Address missing data to provide accurate and useful insights.
- Apply input validation and label encoding techniques for data preparation.
- Provide valuable insights to support investment decisions for unicorn companies.

### PACE Strategy
- **Plan**: Define the scope of each activity, including data structuring, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Analyze**: Analyze the unicorn company dataset, perform EDA, and identify missing data.
- **Construct**: Apply datetime transformations, address missing data, and perform label encoding.
- **Execute**: Use visualizations and insights to answer investor inquiries and provide data for analysis.

Through this project, we aim to provide actionable insights into unicorn companies for investment decisions. By structuring, cleaning, and analyzing the data, we contribute valuable information to assist in identifying potential high-value opportunities and successful investment strategies.
